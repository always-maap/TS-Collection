Performance is essential to deliver high-quality software.
With the recent evolutions of the web, Performance shows its importance even more.
There were a lot of tries to make the web faster, like worker-threads or WASM but still, those are just tools rather than definitive answer.

Algorithms and Data-Structures are the keys to achieve more reliable and performant applications.
"TS-Collection" is a library to help you learn, visualize, and use Algorithm and Data-Structure in your projects.

## Motivation

Algorithm and Data-Structures are always been fascinating to me.
We never can deny the use cases and importance of these subjects.
I truly believe in OSS and wanted to help people learn and use these algorithms.
This library is not perfect since I'm not the best one to write it. I'm learning a lot in this journey too but
I'm trying my best to offer these features with this library.

- **fast.**
  Trying to port the fastest implementation out there.
- **tested.**
  100% coverage for all the files.
- **documented.**
  Documentation for how to write and use these Algorithms and Data-Structures.
  Also API references for this library specifically.
- **vast variety.** Implement the well-known and useful ones.
